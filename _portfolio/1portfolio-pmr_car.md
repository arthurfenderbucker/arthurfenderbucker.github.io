Project time frame: 6 weeks (May 2017 - June 2017)

## Objective:
Design and build an Arduino based line-following cart capable of, when an obstacle in the way is detected, make a sudden and precise braking and stop less than 5 cm from the object.

## My contribution:
- Led a team of six in project execution
- Subdivided the team in three development areas: mechanics, control and sensing.
- Led the process of capturing the team's technical knowledge.
- Integrated results produced by the areas

## Results:
- Met all requirements
- The project held the 1st place in the competition (out of 11 teams)
