title: "Bacterial cultures classifier and separator machine"
excerpt: "In partnership with Fleury Laboratory</br>
"
objective: "Build a semi-industrial machine that automatizes the process of separating and classifying petri dishes with bacterial cultures, according to the bacterial growing state.  "
contribution: "
</br>- Petri dishes barcode reader
</br>- Classification algorithm (data enhancement + preprocessing + CNN)
"
results: "
The classification algorithm was able to perform well even under limited available training data (dataset with 79 images and 4 classes). The maximum accuracy was of 97.7% on the trainset and 94.7% on testset.
