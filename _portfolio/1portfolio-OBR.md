Time frames:  5 months (May - September 2015) / 7 months (march - september 2016)
## Objective:
Develop an autonomous Arduino-controlled robot, with dimensions smaller than 25x25x25 cm, capable of: follow a broken path; make route decisions based on color signals; dodge obstacles; locate and rescue 5mm diameter spheres.

## My contribution:
Leadership: 
- Managed the research and development process in the areas of computing, electronics and mechanics.
- Led a team of four team mates during the development period of both competitions (team technical training, deadline management, sponsorship and project promotion)

## Results:
- In both years the robots met the requirements.
- In 2016, we held the 1st position (among 40 teams) in the state of São Paulo competition stage.
- In 2015 and 2016 we received the award for best private school team in the state of São Paulo.
- The team represented the state of São Paulo in Uberlândia (2015) and Recife (2016)
