title: "Microsof - Airsim Project Demo"
excerpt: ""
objective: "Allow real aerial vehicles to execute autonomous navigation in indoor environments, following simulated paths created by generative models."
contribution: "
</br>- Developed a waypoint based navigation system for indoor drones fusing ORB-SLAM3 and inertial state estimation
</br>- Integrated the navigation system with ROS packages and Airsim trajectory plans.
</br>- Implemented an user interface to control the drone and visualize the navigation system."
results: "</br>- The drone was able to navigate autonomously in a 3D environment, avoiding obstacles and following a pre-defined paths.
</br>- The system was deployed and featured in a official Microsoft Demo"
