I am a pasionate roboticst and AI researcher. 

I am a bachelors student of Mechatronics Eng. at the [University of São Paulo (USP)](https://www5.usp.br/) and, as part of a double degree program, I am pursuing a master’s degree at the [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/en/) in mechatronics and robotics.

My previous projects and researches follow mainly the field of Autonous systems, AI and Robotics. 
**I invite you to check my [Portfolio]({{url}}/portfilio) and [Publications]({{url}}/publications)**.

Recently, I had the oportunity to colaborate with the [Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/) in a research intership at the [AirLab](https://theairlab.org/). The outcome of these 6 months of research were 2 paper published at IEEE - ICRA 2021, [one as 1st author]({{url}}/publication/Coordinating_Multiple_Aerial_Cameras_for_Robot_Cinematography) and [one as 2nd]({{url}}/publication/Learning_a_semantic_control_space_for_expressive_robot_cinematography).

Currently, I am focusing my on the field of Natural-language-facilitated Human-robot Cooperation, while conducting a Research at the [Munich School of Robotics and Machine Inteligence (MSRM)](https://www.msrm.tum.de/msrm/msrm/) in partnership with the [Microsoft Reseach (US)]({{url}}).

In 2020, I became a fellow at the  Fundacão Estudar's Leaders Program, a Merit scholarship program for students with outstanding trajectory and academic potential (24 recipients out of 40,000+ applicants).
