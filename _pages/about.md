I am a passionate roboticist and AI researcher. 

Currently pursuing a PhD in Robotics at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). My research focuses on the field of Robotic Learning facilitated by multimodal Human-Robot-Interaction.

My previous projects and research encompasses the fields of autonomous systems, AI, Robotics and electronics.
**I invite you to check my [Portfolio]({{url}}/portfolio) and [Publications]({{url}}/publications)**.

During my bachelor's in mechatronics engineering at [University of São Paulo (USP)](https://www5.usp.br/) 
I have led the Projects Division of the university's Artificial intelligence group (Grupo Turing), led the technical development of an autonomous drone for international competition, researched on distributed sensing systems and conducted several extracurricular projects on the fields of robotics and AI. Still as undergrad, I published 2 papers at ICRA 2021 on autonomous aerial cinematography (as [1st]({{url}}/publication/Coordinating_Multiple_Aerial_Cameras_for_Robot_Cinematography) and [2nd]({{url}}/publication/Learning_a_semantic_control_space_for_expressive_robot_cinematography) author) 

During my master studies at [TUM](https://www.tum.de/en/), I have led a research partnership between [Munich Institute of Robotics and Machine Intelligence (MIRMI)](https://www.msrm.tum.de/msrm/msrm/) and [Microsoft Resarch]({{https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/autonomous-systems}}). The project focused on the field of Natural-language-facilitated Human-Robot-Interaction, and achieved 2 publications at [IROS 2022]({{url}}/publication/NL_trajectory_reshaper) and [ICRA 2023]({{url}}/publication/LATTE_LAnguage_Trajectory_TransformEr). Both as first author.

Since 2020, I am a fellow at the Fundação Estudar Leaders Program, a Merit scholarship program for students with outstanding trajectory and academic potential (24 selected out of 40,000+ applicants), and a recipient of the AUCANI merit scholarship.
